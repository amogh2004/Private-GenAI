# Private-GenAI
The project explores deploying Generative AI on Edge and Fog computing architectures for low-power, private, and confidential processing. It focuses on containerization, virtualization, and orchestration to optimize performance, minimize power consumption, and ensure data privacy using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Context-Augmented Generation (CAG) methods.
